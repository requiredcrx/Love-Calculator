# Love Calculator
A simple Python program that calculates a love score based on the names of two people. This is my day 4 project in my 100 days of coding challenge.

## How it works
The program takes in the names of two people as input, and uses a simple algorithm to calculate a love score based on the letter and character matching of the names. The love score is represented as a number, with score between 40 and 50 indicating a perfect match and socre below 10 and greater than 90 indicating mediocre match, while other score outside this number is considered a fair match

## Usage
To use the program, clone this repository and run the  `love_calculator.py` script with two arguments:

## Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/username/love-calculator.git
cd love-calculator
python love_calculator.py "John" "Jane"
```
* This will output the love score between John and Jane

## Requirements
* Python 3
* No external library needed
